This package solves least squares problem with high dimensional fixed effects. For a matrix `D` of high dimensional fixed effects, it finds `b` and `系` such that `y = D'b + 系` with `E[D系] = 0`. 

It is the back end for the package [FixedEffectModels.jl](https://github.com/matthieugomez/FixedEffectModels.jl), that estimates linear models with high-dimensional fixed effect.

 The package defines two functions `solve_coefficients!`, that returns the coefficients `b`, and `solve_residuals!`, that returns the residuals `系`. See the documentation `?solve_residuals!` or `?solve_coefficients!`.


```julia
using FixedEffects
# define fixed effects:
p1 = FixedEffect(repeat(1:5, inner = 2))
# combine fixed effects
p2 = FixedEffect(repeat(1:2, outer = 5), repeat(1:2, inner = 5))
# define interacted fixed effects
p3 = FixedEffect(repeat(1:5, outer = 2), interaction = rand(10))

# find residuals
x = rand(10)
solve_residuals!(x, [p1, p2])

# find the fixed effect coefficients
solve_coefficients!(x, [p1, p3])
```



## Installation
The package is registered in the [`General`](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry and so can be installed at the REPL with `] add FixedEffects`.
